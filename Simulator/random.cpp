/***********************************************************************
 * sim_random.cpp:
 *
 * An improved random number generation package.  In addition to the standard
 * rand()/srand() like interface, this package also has a special state info
 * interface.  The initstate() routine is called with a seed, an array of
 * bytes, and a count of how many bytes are being passed in; this array is
 * then initialized to contain information for random number generation with
 * that much state information.  Good sizes for the amount of state
 * information are 32, 64, 128, and 256 bytes.  The state can be switched by
 * calling the setstate() routine with the same array as was initiallized
 * with initstate().  By default, the package runs with 128 bytes of state
 * information and generates far better random numbers than a linear
 * congruential generator.  If the amount of state information is less than
 * 32 bytes, a simple linear congruential R.N.G. is used.
 *
 * Internally, the state information is treated as an array of longs; the
 * zeroeth element of the array is the type of R.N.G. being used (small
 * integer); the remainder of the array is the state information for the
 * R.N.G.  Thus, 32 bytes of state information will give 7 longs worth of
 * state information, which will allow a degree seven polynomial.  (Note:
 * the zeroeth word of state information also has some other information
 * stored in it -- see setstate() for details).
 *
 * The random number generation technique is a linear feedback shift register
 * approach, employing trinomials (since there are fewer terms to sum up that
 * way).  In this approach, the least significant bit of all the numbers in
 * the state table will act as a linear feedback shift register, and will
 * have period 2^deg - 1 (where deg is the degree of the polynomial being
 * used, assuming that the polynomial is irreducible and primitive).  The
 * higher order bits will have longer periods, since their values are also
 * influenced by pseudo-random carries out of the lower bits.  The total
 * period of the generator is approximately deg*(2**deg - 1); thus doubling
 * the amount of state information has a vast influence on the period of the
 * generator.  Note: the deg*(2**deg - 1) is an approximation only good for
 * large deg, when the period of the shift register is the dominant factor.
 * With deg equal to seven, the period is actually much longer than the
 * 7*(2**7 - 1) predicted by this formula.
